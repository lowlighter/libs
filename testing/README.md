[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@lowlighter%2Ftesting?logo=npm&labelColor=cb0000&color=183e4e)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lowlighter/testing) [![Coverage](https://libs-coverage.lecoq.io/testing/badge.svg)](https://libs-coverage.lecoq.io/testing)

Use [Deno](https://deno.com) to perform cross-platform testing on the [Deno](https://deno.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtimes.

- [`üìö Documentation`](https://jsr.io/@libs/testing/doc)

## üìë Examples

```ts
// Because the testing module will spawn runtime processes, permissions are required to run tests.
// You also need to specify any additional permissions required by tests since permissions escalation is not permitted.
// deno test --allow-net=0.0.0.0 --allow-run=deno,bun,npx,node example.ts
import { expect, Status, test } from "./mod.ts"

// Test is performed on all available runtimes by default
// If a runtime is not available, the test is automatically skipped
test("all")("test on all available runtimes", () => {
  expect("https://example.com").toBeUrl()
})

// Test can be restricted to specific runtimes
test("node", "bun")("test only on node and bun runtimes", () => {
  expect("foo").toBeOneOf(["foo", "bar"])
})

// Test on deno are performed without any additional permissions by default
// to satisfy the principle of least privilege, but can be overridden (this is ignored on other runtimes)
// Additionally, everything specified in backticks in test names will be syntax highlighted
test("deno")("test `Deno.serve({ port: 8080 })` with additional `{ permissions: { net: 'inherit' } }`", async () => {
  await using server = Deno.serve({ port: 8080, onListen: () => null }, () => new Response(null, { status: Status.OK }))
  await expect(fetch(`http://${server.addr.hostname}:${server.addr.port}`)).resolves.toRespondWithStatus("2XX")
}, { permissions: { net: "inherit" } })

// You can also use `test.only` (alias to `Deno.test.only`), `test.skip` (alias to `Deno.test.ignore` with gray color),
// and `test.todo` (alias to `Deno.test.skip` with yellow color) to mark tests accordingly
test.todo("node")("todo test")
test.skip("node")("broken test", () => {
  throw new Error()
})
```

## ‚ú® Features

- Extends [`@std/expect`](https://jsr.io/@std/expect) with additional matchers (`toMatchDescriptor`, `toBeImmutable`, `toBeIterable`, `toRespondWithStatus`, `toBeEmail`, etc.)
  - See [`@libs/testing/expect`](https://jsr.io/@libs/testing/doc/expect/~) for more information about available matchers.
- Specify which runtimes should be tested per test case
- Automatically detect which runtimes are available and skip tests accordingly for a streamlined development experience.
- Automatically install dependencies using `deno info` and the correct package manager for each runtime.
- The permissions for deno test are defaulted to `"none"` rather than `"inherit"`.
- Syntax highlighting in test names for better readability.

> [!WARNING]
> Although this library is designed for cross-platform testing, it must be run through Deno.
> Test cases will be spawned in subprocesses.

## ü§ñ Workflow usage

Below is an example on how it could be used within a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow:

```yaml
on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1
        with:
          deno-version: 1.x
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
        with:
          bun-version: 1.x
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22.x
      - run: deno task ci
```

## üïäÔ∏è Migrating from `2.x.x` to `3.x.x`

Version `3.x.x` and onwards require Deno `2.x.x` or later.

### `toBeType("object")` and `null`

The `toBeType("object")` matcher now excludes `null` by default.
The second argument has been replaced by an object with a `nullable` property for better readability.

```diff
- expect(null).toBeType("object", !null)
+ expect(null).toBeType("object", { nullable: true })
```

### Updated headers and syntax highlighting

The prefix for runtime in test names has been changed to be displayed in uppercase over a colored background.
If you were using the `deno test --filter` option, you will need to update your filter accordingly.

```diff
- [deno]
+  DENO
```

Additionally, test names now syntax highlight everything specified in backticks.
