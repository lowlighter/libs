## üîë Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)

Issue a new TOTP secret with metadata (issuer, account, image, etc.).

- [`ü¶ï Playground`](https://libs.lecoq.io/crypto/totp)
- [`üìö Documentation`](https://jsr.io/@libs/crypto/doc/totp/~)

### ‚ú® Features

- Has no external dependencies.
- Is lightweight.

This library is based on the well-written article of [@rajat-sr](https://github.com/rajat-sr) [How To Implement Google Authenticator Two Factor Auth in JavaScript](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-implement-google-authenticator-two-factor-auth-in-javascript-091wy3vh3)

## üîê Symmetric encryption (using AES-GCM 256 with a PBKDF2 derived key)

- [`ü¶ï Playground`](https://libs.lecoq.io/crypto/encryption)
- [`üìö Documentation`](https://jsr.io/@libs/crypto/doc/encryption/~)

### ‚ú® Features

- Use the native [`Web Crypto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) APIs.
- Uses a [`AES-GCM 256-bits`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) with [`PBKDF2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)-derived key to encrypt and decrypt messages.
  - Encrypted messages are different each time thanks to an [initialization vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector).
  - The derived keys from a given `seed`/`password` are always the same.
- Includes functionalities to introduce additional entropy:
  - Support for [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) to guarantee integrity.
  - Support for retaining the stored size to help verify integrity _(for messages with length < 255)_
  - Support for adding padding to force length be `256` or `512` bytes and obfuscate the original size _(can be disabled using `0` as value)_
