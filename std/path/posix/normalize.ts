/**
 * Normalize the `path`, resolving `'..'` and `'.'` segments.
 * Note that resolving these segments does not necessarily mean that all will be eliminated.
 * A `'..'` at the top-level will be preserved, and an empty path is canonically `'.'`.
 *
 * @example Usage
 * ```ts
 * import { normalize } from "@std/path/posix/normalize";
 * import { assertEquals } from "@std/assert";
 *
 * const path = normalize("/foo/bar//baz/asdf/quux/..");
 * assertEquals(path, "/foo/bar/baz/asdf");
 * ```
 *
 * @param path The path to normalize.
 * @return The normalized path.
