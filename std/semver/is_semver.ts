/**
 * Checks to see if value is a valid SemVer object. It does a check
 * into each field including prerelease and build.
 *
 * Some invalid SemVer sentinels can still return true such as ANY and INVALID.
 * An object which has the same value as a sentinel but isn't reference equal
 * will still fail.
 *
 * Objects which are valid SemVer objects but have _extra_ fields are still
 * considered SemVer objects and this will return true.
 *
 * A type assertion is added to the value.
 *
 * @example Usage
 * ```ts
 * import { isSemVer } from "@std/semver/is-semver";
 * import { assert } from "@std/assert";
 *
 * const value = {
 *   major: 1,
 *   minor: 2,
 *   patch: 3,
 * };
 *
 * assert(isSemVer(value));
 * assert(!isSemVer({ major: 1, minor: 2 }));
 * ```
 *
 * @param value The value to check to see if its a valid SemVer object
 * @return True if value is a valid SemVer otherwise false
