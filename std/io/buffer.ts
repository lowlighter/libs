/**
 * A variable-sized buffer of bytes with `read()` and `write()` methods.
 *
 * Buffer is almost always used with some I/O like files and sockets. It allows
 * one to buffer up a download from a socket. Buffer grows and shrinks as
 * necessary.
 *
 * Buffer is NOT the same thing as Node's Buffer. Node's Buffer was created in
 * 2009 before JavaScript had the concept of ArrayBuffers. It's simply a
 * non-standard ArrayBuffer.
 *
 * ArrayBuffer is a fixed memory allocation. Buffer is implemented on top of
 * ArrayBuffer.
 *
 * Based on {@link https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Buffer | Go Buffer}.
 *
 * @example Usage
 * ```ts
 * import { Buffer } from "@std/io/buffer";
 * import { assertEquals } from "@std/assert/equals";
 *
 * const buf = new Buffer();
 * await buf.write(new TextEncoder().encode("Hello, "));
 * await buf.write(new TextEncoder().encode("world!"));
 *
 * const data = new Uint8Array(13);
 * await buf.read(data);
 *
 * assertEquals(new TextDecoder().decode(data), "Hello, world!");
 * ```
