 * Calls the given (possibly asynchronous) function up to `maxAttempts` times.

 * The backoff is calculated by multiplying `minTimeout` with `multiplier` to the power of the current attempt counter (starting at 0 up to `maxAttempts - 1`). It is capped at `maxTimeout` however.
 * How long the actual delay is, depends on `jitter`.
 *
 * When `jitter` is the default value of `1`, waits between two attempts for a
 * randomized amount between 0 and the backoff time. With the default options
